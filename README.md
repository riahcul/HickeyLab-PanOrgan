# HickeyLab-PanOrgan
NOTE: Currently having some problems with pushing changes to GitHub, so the markdown files have been removed for the time being but the .pdf files are accessible!

In the Hickey Lab, my project focuses on visually representing and contextualizing the data analyzed by my subteam. Currently, I have documents for both metadata and locations of spatial data analysis!
