# HickeyLab-PanOrganAnalysis

#### Mariah Culpepper 2025

In the Hickey Lab, my project focuses on visually representing and contextualizing the data compiled and processed my subteam. My visualizations span metadata, locations of spatial data, and other datasets focusing on the creation of a merged hierarchical dataset. Without context and purpose, data solely existsâ€”it cannot be transformed into knowledge or insight.

This is the central repository used for all of my visualizations. One can also find updates on the Hickey LabArchives in the PanOrgan folder.

Here is a pipeline that describes what the PanOrgan subgroup focuses on. In this repository, you will find the interpretation of spatial data and the creation of visualizations.

All of my visualizations are created in RStudio and can be replicated in the attached R markdown files.
